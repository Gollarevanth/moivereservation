This code creates a simple and visually appealing Movie Ticket Booking webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The HTML structure contains a form where users can input their name, email, movie selection, show date and time, and the number of tickets they want to book.
The CSS styles the form to give it a modern, dark-themed design with smooth input fields and a bright, eye-catching "Book Now" button.
When the form is submitted, JavaScript prevents the page from reloading, displays a success message, and clears the form fields.
Although it looks fully functional, the form currently does not connect to a real backend or database—it’s meant as a front-end demonstration.
This makes it perfect for learning, prototyping, or as a base to build a complete ticket reservation system.
